They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to the data analytics professional and ask for a data-driven suggestions based on the understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

### The goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. 

### If the analysis can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
